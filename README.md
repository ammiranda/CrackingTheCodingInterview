Cracking the Coding Interview Solutions
===

###Overview

My solutions to various interview questions that are posed in Cracking the Coding Interview by Gayle Laakmann McDowell.

###How to Read

I have sorted the solutions in directories by language used. For example 'js' is for JavaScript implementations.  Within the language directory I have lib and solutions directories.  The lib contains the data structure and/or algorithms necessary to arrive at the desired solution.  The solutions directory contains the answers to questions in the book contained in folders that are named the same as the chapter and question numbers in the book.  Folder 2.2 has the solution to the second question in chapter two, etc.
